        <h2 class="peanut-butter">Peanut Butter</h2>
        <p>
            Peanut butter is a food paste or spread made from ground, dry-roasted peanuts. It commonly contains
            additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as salt, sweeteners, or emulsifiers. Peanut
            butter is consumed in many countries. The United States is a leading exporter of peanut butter and one of
            the largest consumers of peanut butter annually per capita. January 24 is National Peanut Butter Day in the
            United States.<br><br>
            Peanut butter is a nutrient-rich food containing high levels of protein, several vitamins, and dietary
            minerals. It is typically served as a spread on bread, toast, or crackers, and used to make sandwiches
            (notably the peanut butter and jelly sandwich). It is also used in a number of breakfast dishes and
            desserts, such as peanut-flavored granola, smoothies, crepes, cookies, brownies, or croissants. It is
            similar to other nut butters such as cashew butter and almond butter.

        <h3 class="peanut-butter">History</h3>
        <p>
            As the US National Peanut Board confirms, "Contrary to popular belief, George Washington Carver did not
            invent peanut butter." Carver was given credit in popular folklore for many inventions that did not come
            out of his lab. By the time Carver published his document about peanuts, entitled "How to Grow the Peanut
            and 105 Ways of Preparing it For Human Consumption" in 1916, many methods of preparation of peanut butter
            had already been developed or patented by various pharmacists, doctors, and food scientists working in the
            US and Canada.<br><br>

            A related dish named "pinda-käse" (peanut cheese) existed in Suriname by 1783. This was more solid than
            modern peanut butter, and could be cut and served in slices like cheese. Pinda bravoe, a soup-like peanut
            based dish, also existed in Suriname around that time. Modern peanut butter is still referred to as
            "pindakaas" (peanut cheese) in Dutch for this reason, Suriname having been a Dutch colony at that time.
            When peanut butter was brought onto the market in the Netherlands by Calvé in 1948 , it was not allowed to
            do so under the name "peanut butter". The name "butter" was specifically defined for real butter, to avoid
            confusion with margarine.<br><br>

            While the earliest example of grinding peanuts into paste has been traced to the Aztecs and Incas, the US
            National Peanut Board credits three modern inventors with the earliest patents related to the production of
            modern peanut butter.<br><br>

            Marcellus Gilmore Edson of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, obtained a patent for a method of producing peanut
            butter from roasted peanuts using heated surfaces in 1884. Edson's cooled product had "a consistency
            like that of butter, lard, or ointment" according to his patent application which described a process of
            milling roasted peanuts until the peanuts reached "a fluid or semi-fluid state". He mixed sugar into the
            paste to harden its consistency.<br><br>

            John Harvey Kellogg, known for his line of prepared breakfast cereals, was an advocate of using plant foods
            as a healthier dietary choice rather than meat. He was issued a patent for a "Process of Producing
            Alimentary Products" in 1898, and used peanuts, although he boiled the peanuts rather than roasting them.
             Kellogg's Western Health Reform Institute served peanut butter to patients because they needed a food that
            contained a lot of protein that could be eaten without chewing. At first, peanut butter was a food
            for wealthy people, as it became popular initially as a product served at expensive health care institutes.
            <br><br>

            Early peanut-butter-making machines were developed by Joseph Lambert, who had worked at John Harvey
            Kellogg's Battle Creek Sanatorium, and Dr. Ambrose Straub who obtained a patent for a peanut-butter-making
            machine in 1903.<br><br>

            A businessman from St. Louis named George Bayle produced and sold peanut butter in the form of a snack food
            in 1894.
